            In the modern educational landscape, efficient class scheduling is a crucial aspect for educational institutions.
          It involves assigning courses, professors, classrooms, and timeslots to create a balanced and optimal timetable
          that meets the needs of both students and faculty. Traditional methods of scheduling are often time-consuming
          and complex due to various constraints and preferences. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a Class
          Scheduling Application that employs a Genetic Algorithm implemented using the DEAP library to automate and
          optimize the scheduling process.

        <h3 class="card-subtitle text-center">Overview of the Application:</h3><br><br>
        <ol class="card-text">
          <li><strong>Course Definition and Entry:</strong> Users start by defining the courses offered by the
            institution. Each course is characterized by its name, required duration, and any associated constraints,
            such as prerequisites or preferred timeslots. The application allows users to enter course details through
            an intuitive interface.</li>
          <li><strong>Professor Assignment:</strong> Professors are then assigned to the courses based on their
            expertise. Users input the list of professors along with their availability, preferences, and
            specialization areas. The Genetic Algorithm aims to allocate professors to courses in a way that optimally
            distributes the teaching load and respects their preferences.</li>
          <li><strong>Classroom Allocation:</strong> Classrooms are added to the system, along with their seating
            capacity and available facilities. The application ensures that classrooms are efficiently utilized by
            assigning courses that fit their capacity and requirements. Constraints such as course type (lecture, lab)
            and equipment availability are considered during this process.</li>
          <li><strong>Timeslot Assignment:</strong> Timeslots represent the available time intervals for conducting
            classes. Users define the time slots for each day, considering the institution's schedule. The Genetic
            Algorithm then strategically assigns timeslots to courses, professors, and classrooms, aiming to minimize
            conflicts and gaps in the timetable.</li>
          <li><strong>Genetic Algorithm Implementation:</strong> The core of the application lies in the Genetic
            Algorithm, which uses the DEAP library to evolve and optimize the class schedule. The algorithm starts
            with an initial population of schedules and iteratively applies selection, crossover, and mutation
            operations to create new generations of schedules. The fitness function evaluates each schedule based on
            factors such as course distribution, professor preferences, classroom availability, and timeslot clashes.</li>
          <li><strong>Optimization and Evaluation:</strong> The Genetic Algorithm iterates through multiple
            generations, gradually improving the quality of schedules. The application provides tools to visualize and
            evaluate different schedules, allowing users to assess the trade-offs and make informed decisions. Users
            can analyze the fitness score and the distribution of classes across timeslots and classrooms.</li>
          <li><strong>Final Schedule Generation:</strong> Once an optimal schedule is achieved, users can generate the
            final timetable. The application provides the scheduled courses, professors, classrooms, and timeslots in a
            user-friendly format, ready to be shared with students and faculty.</li>

        <p class="card-text">
          The Class Scheduling Application using the Genetic Algorithm in the DEAP library changes the way
          educational institutions handle the complex task of class scheduling. By automating the process and
          considering various constraints and preferences, the application streamlines scheduling operations and
          reduces manual effort. The ability to optimize the distribution of courses, professors, classrooms, and
          timeslots ultimately leads to a more efficient and balanced academic environment.
